Tile Engine Virtual Machine
===========================

Concepts
--------

Little Endian or Big Endian. Implementations can choose to support one or the
other. Memory accesses and encoding will both respect the setting.

Register-based, separated by scopes.
Functions have local registers.

System registers -- 2048 64-bit (16K) available to all scripts.
Shared registers -- 1024 64-bit (8K) available to share in scripting group.
Process registers -- 960 64-bit (7K) available per script instance.
Local registers -- 64 64-bit (0.5K) available per function.
-- Maximum of 32K in local registers (max. function depth of 64)
-- Configurable in app

All registers (a total of 4096) are addressable with 12-bits.

Fixed-length instructions (32-bits per token).


Instruction Encoding
--------------------

The first byte of each instruction indicates the opcode. All opcodes fit within
six-bits.

The leading two-bits indicate whether the corresponding source operand is a
register (0) or a literal (1). If it is a literal then an extra 64-bits (two
tokens) need to be skipped after the current instruction.

The remaining six-bits represent the actual opcode.

The rest of the token depends on the classification of the opcode.

Binary operations are encoded with 12-bits representing the target register, and
a pair of 6-bit values representing the left and right hand source local
registers.

	[EE|OOOOOO|DDDDDDDDDDDD|LLLLLL|RRRRRR]
	- E = Early bits (the first two-bits)
	- O = Opcode bits
	- D = Destination (target) register bits
	- L = Left-hand register bits
	- R = Right-hand register bits

Comparison operations are encoded with 12-bits representing the first register,
and another 12-bits representing the second register.

	[EE|OOOOOO|AAAAAAAAAAAA|BBBBBBBBBBBB]
	- E = Early bits
	- O = Opcode bits
	- A = First register (A) bits
	- B = Second register (B) bits

Unary operators are encoded the same as comparison operators. The first register
represents the target, and the second represents the source.

	[EE|OOOOOO|DDDDDDDDDDDD|SSSSSSSSSSSS]
	- E = Early bits
	- O = Opcode bits
	- D = Destination (target) register bits
	- S = Source register bits

Casting operators are encoded with 12-bits representing the target, 1-bit
representing the signed-ness of the target, 1-bit representing the signed-ness
of the source, 2-bits representing the target's size, 2-bits representing the
source's size, and 6-bits representing the source local register.

	- The signed-ness of a float is ignored.
	- The two-bit size encoding represents (1<<size) bytes.
	--- 0b00 = 1<<0 = 1 byte.
	--- 0b01 = 1<<1 = 2 bytes.
	--- 0b10 = 1<<2 = 4 bytes.
	--- 0b11 = 1<<3 = 8 bytes.

	- Casting operators using a literal for the target represent the target's
	` unaligned memory address.
	- If the target is larger than the source then this is an extension.
	- If the target is smaller than the source then this is a truncation.
	- If either the target or the source is signed then the extension is a sign
	` extension. (Integer to integer casts only.)
	--- If the target is a float then the the signed-ness of the extension
	`   depends on whether the source is signed.

	[EE|OOOOOO|DDDDDDDDDDDD|T|Z|LL|NN|SSSSSS]
	- E = Early bits
	- O = Opcode bits
	- D = Destination (target) register bits
	- T = Signed-ness-of-target bits
	- Z = Signed-ness-of-source bits
	- L = Length-of-target bits
	- N = Length-of-source bits
	- S = Local source register bits

Memory operations are encoded with 6-bits representing the target or source
local register, 2-bits representing the size of the operation as (1<<n) bytes,
and 16-bits representing the memory encoding.

-- If not using a literal then the memory encoding is as follows:
---- First six-bits indicate the register to load the address from.
---- Next 2-bits indicate the scaling factor for the offset (1<<scale).
---- Next 8-bits indicate the offset to apply to the address.
---- Thus: addressInBytes = regs[addressRegister] + offset*(1<<scaleFactor)
-- If using a literal then the memory encoding is expected to be all zeroes.
---- The memory encoding and literal might play together in other ways later, so
`    the bits should be zeroed for future compatibility.
-- A literal can also be used to reference the register. In which case only the
`  lower 12-bits of the literal are used as the register.

	[EE|OOOOOO|RRRRRR|NN|MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM]
	- E = Early bits
	- O = Opcode bits
	- R = Register bits
	- N = Operation size bits
	- M = Memory bits

Label operations are encoded with 1-bit representing the "mode," and 23-bits
encoded depending on the mode given. If the mode bit is 0 then the remaining
23-bits represent the signed relative instruction pointer, divided by 4 (which
enforces 4-byte alignment). Otherwise, the mode bit is 1, the following
12-bits represent the register to source from, 2-bits indicate the scaling
factor for the offset (1<<scale), and the last 9-bits indicate the offset to
apply to the address.

-- 32MB is addressable if not using a literal (and the mode is 0).
-- If using a literal, then an unaligned address is used.

	[EE|OOOOOO|S|MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM]
	- E = Early bits
	- O = Opcode bits
	- S = Mode select bit
	- M = Label address bits

"Void" operations (operations that don't take parameters) are expected to encode
their remaining bits with zeros.

Calling a Function (Arguments/Returns)
--------------------------------------

The "Call" and "CallIndirect" operations will accept a second parameter, aside
from the label. This is encoded by setting the second parameter's bit to a
literal. This "argument count" literal is encoded as follows:

- Bit 0: Argument count literal/register
- Bit 1: Return count literal/register
- Bit 2..7: Reserved. Set to zero.
- Bit 8..19: Argument count. If bit 0 is clear then this is a literal. Otherwise
`            bit 0 is set and this represents a register.
- Bit 20..31: Return count. If bit 1 is clear then this is a literal. Otherwise
`             bit 1 is set and this represents a register.
- Bit 32..63: Reserved. Set to zero.

The decoded argument count represents the number of local registers to mirror
into the callee's local registers.

The decoded return count represents the number of local registers to mirror into
the caller's local registers (from the callee) upon the corresponding RET.

Mirroring starts at local register zero and is limited to a maximum of 64 local
registers (the full range).



Tile Engine Scripting Language
==============================

Built-in Types
--------------

bool        // Boolean
int         // 64-bit signed integer
uint        // 64-bit unsigned integer
float       // 64-bit float (double)
string      // Mutable string object
substring   // Immutable string object reference
object      // Generic object


Collections
-----------

[]T         // Array slice
[N]T        // Static array, N-elements in length
[dynamic]T  // Array object
[K:T]       // Binary tree (keys of type K, holds type T)


Type Modifiers
--------------

^           // Pointer
?           // Optional

Pointer and optional may be combined (^?) to mean "nullable pointer." Pointers
are otherwise assumed to never be null.


Numeric Literals
----------------

Binary numbers are written as 0b<BinarySequence>.
Octal numbers are written as 0c<OctalSequence>.
Decimal numbers are written as <DecimalSequence>.
Hexadecimal numbers are written as 0x<HexadecimalSequence>.

Numbers can be given an arbitrary base (between 2 and 36). They are written as
<Radix>r<Sequence>. 36 allows the use of all numbers and English letters. 2 is
the same as binary; 8 the same as octal; 10 the same as decimal; 16 hexadecimal.

Floats can omit either the leading sequence or the trailing sequence. If a
sequence is omitted then zero is implied. Only the leading sequence can specify
a radix.

The exponent can be specified with 'e' or 'p' if either of those are valid given
the radix for the float. ('e' won't be valid in hexadecimal. 'p' won't be valid
in certain arbitrary radices.)

The exponent marker can be immediately followed by an optional '+' or '-'. If
omitted then '+' is implied.


String Literals and Localization
--------------------------------

All strings are encoded in UTF-8.

A string literal followed by ':' and a number will be given a localization ID.
Depending on the settings of the script's interpreter, the text for the string
may be replaced by a string in an external file based on the current language.

e.g., "Hello":1000 could be replaced with "Bonjour," or "こんにちは," or some
`     other text based on the current language.

String literals are escaped by default. To disable escapes, prefix the string
literal with '~'. Escaped string literals use the backslash ('\') to initiate an
escape sequence. The following escape sequences exist:

	\a          Alarm
	\b          Backspace
	\f          Form feed
	\r          Carriage return
	\t          Tab
	\u{<H>*}    Insert Unicode code-point
	\u<HHHH>    Insert Unicode code-point
	\U<HHHHH>   Insert Unicode code-point
	\v          Vertical tab
	\x<HH>      Insert direct hexadecimal value (encoded as byte)
	\<OOO>      Insert direct octal value (encoded as byte)
	\\          Backslash
	\'          Apostrophe
	\"          Quotation mark
	\?          Question mark
	\#<H>       \xFF\xFF\x01\xF<H> (Select foreground color)
	\$<H>       \xFF\xFF\x02\xF<H> (Select background color)
	\^(<a>;<b>) \xFF\xFF\x03(<a>)\xFF\xFF\x04(<b>)\xFF\xFF\x05 (Ruby text)
	\!<H>       \xFF\xFF\x06\xF<H> (Toggle effect)
	\[<H>       \xFF\xFF\x07\xF<H> (Enable effect)
	\]<H>       \xFF\xFF\x08\xF<H> (Disable effect)
	\.<D>       \xFF\xFF\x09\xF<T> (Delay)

<H+> means "hexadecimal"
<O+> means "octal"
<D+> means "decimal"
<a> and <b> are used to imply a string of variable length.

The use of \xFF\xFF in a string is used to imply a special interpretation of the
string in whatever is reading it. The byte after that selects the operation.

\x01 means "select foreground color." The byte following it is 0xF<H>. (e.g., if
the color is "0" then the byte is 0xF0.) The <H> part represents the color.

\x02 means "select background color." This is the same as \x01 in terms of
encoding.

\x03 means "start ruby text." The characters from here until \xFF\xFF\x04 are
the "main text." (See the description of ruby text below.)

\x04 means "ruby text separator." The characters from here until \xFF\xFF\x05
are the "ruby text." (See the description of ruby text below.)

\x05 means "end ruby text." This is used as a separator for ruby text.  (See the
description of ruby text below.)

\x06 means "toggle effect." The effect byte following (\xF<H>) represents the
effect. If the effect is enabled then this disables it. Likewise, if the effect
is disabled, then this enables it. This works on the current "enabled level" of
the effect.

\x07 means "begin effect." This increments the "enabled count" of an effect. The
count maximum is 255.

\x08 means "leave effect." This decrements the "enabled count" of an effect. The
count minimum is 0.

\x09 means "delay." This is used to imply that the system displaying the text
should introduce a short delay before proceeding to the next character.

(Color Palette)
This is determined by the system interpreting the string. This will likely be
sourced from some theme configuration file.

(Ruby Text)
In Japanese, Ruby text is used to clarify the pronunciation of a given kanji by
displaying smaller hiragana (called furigana) above the kanji. This is
especially the case for names which often need clarification.

A simple example of ruby text syntax:

	"In Japanese, \^(水;みず) means \"water.\""

(Effect Index)
The meaning of the effect depends entirely upon the system interpreting the
string.

(Delay Timing)
The amount of time to be used for a delay depends on the system interpreting it.
The larger the number, the longer the delay.


Defining Variables / Fields
---------------------------

// Explicit type
<varname> ':' <typeref> [ '=' <expression> ]
// Implicit type
<varname> ':=' <expression>

// Register-type specification
'@register' '(' <registertype> ')' <vardecl>

// Register types:
'system' // matches "System" register group (all scripts)
'shared' // matches "Shared" register group (whole script group)
'global' // matches "Process" register group (per script instance)
'local'  // matches "Local" register group (per function call)


User-Defined Types
------------------

<structname> '::' 'struct' '{'
	<fields>
'}'

	EntStats :: struct {
		health, maxHealth: uint
		attackMultiplier: float
	}


Defining Functions
------------------

<functionname> '::' <fnquals> '(' <parameters...> ')' '->' <typeref> '{'
	<statements...>
'}'

<functionname> '::' <fnquals> '(' <parameters...> ')' [ '->' <typeref> ] '=>' <expression>

	fib :: ( x: int ) -> int {
		if x < 3 {
			return 1
		} else {
			return fib( x - 1 ) + fib( x - 2 )
		}
	}

	getSum :: ( x, y: int ) => x + y

// Qualifiers:
'override' // this function overrides an interface function (e.g., onFixedStep)
'mutating' // this function modifies state


Control Flow
------------

// Statement form
if <expr> {
	<stmts>
} else if <expr> {
	<stmts>
} else {
	<stmts>
}

if <expr> do <stmt> else if <expr> do <stmt> else do <stmt>

// Expression form
if <expr> {
	<expr>
} else if <expr> {
	<expr>
} else {
	<expr>
}

// Expression form (operator)
<expr> ? <expr> : <expr>

switch <expr> {
	case <value>
		<stmts>
	case <value>
		<stmts>
	default
		<stmts>
}

break
continue


Loops
-----

while <expr> {
	<stmts>
}

	while !escape_key() {
		main_loop()
	}

repeat {
	<stmts>
} until <expr>

	repeat {
		main_loop()
	} until escape_key()

loop {
	<stmts>
}

	loop {
		main_loop()
		if escape_key() {
			break
		}
	}

for <stmt>, <expr>, <stmt> {
}

	for i = 0, i < n, ++i {
	}

for <expr> {
}

	for [ 2, 4, 6, 8 ] {
		// Loop implicitly defines '$it' and '$index'
		//  - '$it' is the value of the item in the iteration
		//  - '$index' is its index
		print( "\($index + 1). \($it)" )
	}

// "For each <x> in <y>"
for <varname> := <expr> {
}

	digitSuffixes :: [ "st", "nd", "rd", "th" ]
	for item := items {
		suffixIndex :: min( $index % 10, last_index(digitSuffixes) )
		print( "The \($index)\(digitSuffixes[suffixIndex]) item is \(item)" )
	}


Optionals
---------

// Can only access through a let conditional
let <varname> = <optional>


	// Example

	Player :: struct {
		name: string
		health, maxHealth: uint
	}

	thePlayers: [dynamic]Player

	find_player :: ( name: string ) -> ?Player {
		for player^ := thePlayers {
			if player.name == name {
				return player
			}
		}

		return null
	}

	rename_player :: ( oldName, newName: string ) -> bool {
		if let player := find_player( oldName ) {
			player.name = newName
			return true
		}

		return false
	}


Autoprint Statements
--------------------

A string literal on its own line is a statement which invokes the autoprint
handler. There are several additional decorations that can be used to invoke
special functionality.

This system is primarily in place to aid in story-centric (RPG, VN) games.

@ "Speaker"
"Normal text"		// 【Speaker】「Normal text」
> "Quoted text"		// 【Speaker】『Quoted text』
< "Thought text"	// 【Speaker】（Thought text）
/ "Narrative text"	// Narrative text

Localized strings can also be used. e.g.,

	#en "Hello, world!"
	#jp こんにちは、世界！


Error Handling
--------------

// Development-mode only check
assert <expr> [ , <message> ]

	e.g., assert divisor != 0, "Division by zero"

// Verify some condition
verify <expr> [ , <message> ]

	e.g., if verify divisor != 0 { number /= divisor }
